            <p>
                Our scheduling and logistics require significant planning and resource allocation to ensure a smooth moving experience. 
                By booking a move, you agree to our non-refundable policy due to the following reasons:

                <li>📅 <b>Limited Availability:</b> Once a slot is booked, we may have to turn down other customers.</li>
                <li>⏳ <b>Operational Costs:</b> Planning a move involves upfront expenses, including fuel and labor costs.</li>
